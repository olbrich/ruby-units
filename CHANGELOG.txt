2007-07-14  1.1.1   * fixed bug that would prevent creating '<pound-mass>' units, which
                      prevented rounding from working
                    * tests do not fail if Uncertain gem is not installed, you just get an

                    * fixed to_datetime and to_date to convert durations to datetimes and dates'

2007-01-24  1.0.2   * Minor changes in the way powers are calculated to support Uncertain
                      numbers better.
                    * Fixed parsing bug with Uncertain Numbers
                    * added resolution / typography units (pixels, points, pica)
                      Note that 'pt' means 'pints' and not 'points'
                    * added some pressure units ('inHg' & 'inH2O')
                    * changed default abbreviation of 'knots' to 'kt'
                    * Changed directory layout

2007-01-17  1.0.1   * Force units are now defined correctly.

2007-01-12  1.0.0   * Improved handling of complex numbers.  Now you can specify
                      '1+1i mm'.unit to get a complex unit.
                    * Taking the root of a negative unit will give you a complex unit
                    * fixed unary minus to work again
                    * Math.hypot now takes units.  Both parameters must be the compatible
                      units or it will assert.  Units will be converted to a common base
                      before use.
                    * Can now specify units in rational numbers, i.e., '1/4 cup'.unit
                    * Seems like a good time to move to 1.0 status

2006-12-15  0.3.9   * forgot to increment the version in the gem file..ooops.

2006-12-15  0.3.8   * Any object that supports a 'to_unit' method will now be
                      automatically coerced to a unit during math operations.

2006-12-14  0.3.7   * improved handling of percents and added a 'wt%' unit
                      equivalent to 1 g/dl.
                    * Improved handling for units with non-alphanumeric names
                      (like ' for feet, # for pound)
                    * Now you can enter durations as "HH:MM:SS, usec" or
                      "HH:MM:SS:usec"

2006-12-05  0.3.6   * Fixed bug where (unit/unit).ceil would fail

2006-11-20  0.3.5   * Minor bug fixes
                    * to_int now coerces the result to an actual Integer,
                      but only works properly for unitless Units.

2006-10-27  0.3.4   * Fixed a few more parsing bugs so that it will properly
                      complain about malformed units.
                    * Fixed a bug that prevents proper use of percents
                    * several minor tweaks
                    * some improved Date and DateTime handling
                    * can convert between Date, DateTime, and Time objects
                    * Time math will now return a DateTime if it goes out of
                      range.

2006-10-03  0.3.3   * Apparently I can't do math late at night.
                      Fixed a bug that would cause problems when adding
                      or subtracting units to a unit with a zero scalar.
                    * Date and DateTime objects can be converted to 'units'

2006-10-03  0.3.2   * More minor bug fixes
                      (now fixes a minor name collision with rails)

2006-10-02  0.3.1   * minor bug fixes

2006-10-02  0.3.0   * Performance enhanced by caching results of many
                      functions (Thanks to Kurt Stephens for pushing this.)
                    * Throws an exception if the unit is not recognized
                    * units can now identify what 'kind' they are
                      (:length, :mass, etc..)
                    * New constructors:
                      Unit(1,"mm")
                      Unit(1,"mm/s")
                      Unit(1,"mm","s")

2006-09-22  0.2.3   * added support for date/time parsing with the Chronic gem
                      parsing will use Chronic if it is loaded
                    * allows Date / Time / DateTime conversions
                    * better test coverage
                    * The 'string'.to_time returns a Time object
                    * 'string'.to_datetime returns a DateTime object
                    * 'string'.time returns a Time object or a DateTime if the
                      Time object fails
                    * 'string'.datetime returns a DateTime or a Time if the
                      DateTime fails

2006-09-19  0.2.2   * tweaked temperature handling a bit.  Now enter
                      temperatures like this:
                      '0 tempC'.unit #=> 273.15 degK
                      They will always be converted to kelvin to avoid
                      problems when temperatures are used in equations.
                    * added Time.in("5 min")
                    * added Unit.to_unit to simplify some calls

2006-09-18  0.2.1   * Trig math functions (sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh)
                      accept units that can be converted to radians
                      Math.sin("90 deg".unit) => 1.0
                    * Date and DateTime can be offset by a time unit
                      (Date.today + "1 day".unit) => 2006-09-19
                      Does not work with months since they aren't a consistent
                      size
                    * Tweaked time usage a bit
                      Time.now + "1 hr".unit => Mon Sep 18 11:51:29 EDT 2006
                    * can output time in 'hh:mm:ss' format by using
                     'unit.to_s(:time)'
                    * added time helper methods
                      ago,
                      since(Time/DateTime),
                      until(Time/DateTime),
                      from(Time/DateTime),
                      before(Time/DateTime), and
                      after(Time/DateTime)
                    * Time helpers also work on strings.  In this case they
                      are first converted to units
                      '5 min'.from_now
                      '1 week'.ago
                      'min'.since(time)
                      'min'.until(time)
                      '1 day'.from()
                    * Can pass Strings to time helpers and they will be parsed
                      with ParseDate
                    * Fixed most parsing bugs (I think)
                    * Can pass a strftime format string to to_s to format time
                      output
                    * can use U'1 mm' or '1 mm'.u to specify units now

2006-09-17          * can now use the '%' format specifier like
                      '%0.2f' % '1 mm'.unit #=> '1.00 mm'
                    * works nicely with time now.
                      '1 week'.unit + Time.now => 1.159e+09 s
                      Time.at('1.159e+09 s'.unit)
                        => Sat Sep 23 04:26:40 EDT 2006
                      "1.159e9 s".unit.time
                        => Sat Sep 23 04:26:40 EDT 2006
                    * Time.now.unit => 1.159e9 s
                    * works well with 'Uncertain' numerics
                      (www.rubyforge.org/projects/uncertain)
                    * Improved parsing

2006-08-28  0.2.0   * Added 'ruby_unit.rb' file so that requires will still
                      work if the wrong name is used
                    * Added 'to' as an alias to '>>' so conversions can be
                      done as '1 m'.unit.to('1 cm')
                    * Added ability to convert temperatures to absolute values
                      using the following syntax:
                        '37 degC'.unit.to('tempF')  #=> '98.6 degF'.unit
                    * Tweaked abbreviations a bit.  'ton' is now 'tn' instead
                      of 't'.  It was causing parse collisions with 'atm'.
                    * fixed a bug in term elimination routine
                    * fixed a bug in parsing of powers, and added support for
                      'm**2' format
                    * Added support for taking roots of units.  Just
                      exponentiate with a fraction (0.5, 1.0/3, 0.25)
                    * renamed 'quantity' to 'scalar'
                    * any type of Numeric can be used to initialize a Unit,
                      although this can't really be done with a string
                    * Units can not be forced to a float using to_f unless
                      they are unitless.  This prevents some math functions
                      from forcing the conversion.  To get the scalar, just
                      use 'unit.scalar'
                    * 'inspect' returns string representation
                    * better edge-case detection with math functions.
                      "0 mm".unit**-1 now throws a ZeroDivisionError exception
                    * Ranges can make a series of units, so long as the end
                      points have integer scalars.
                    * Fixed a parsing bug with feet/pounds and scientific
                      numbers

2006-08-22  0.1.1   * Added new format option "1 mm".to_unit("in") now
                      converts the result to the indicated units
                    * Fixed some naming issues so that the gem name matches
                      the require name.
                    * Added CHANGELOG
                    * Improved test coverage (100% code coverage via RCov)
                    * fixed a bug that prevented units with a prefix in the
                      denominator from converting properly
                    * can use .unit method on a string to create a new unit
                      object
                    * can now coerce or define units from arrays, strings,
                      numerics.
                        "1 mm".unit + [1, 'mm'] === "2 mm".unit
                        [1,'mm','s'].unit === "1 mm/s".unit
                        2.5.unit === "2.5".unit
                    * Added instructions on how to add custom units

2006-08-22  0.1.0   * Initial Release
