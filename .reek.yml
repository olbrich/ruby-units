# Reek configuration
#
# InstanceVariableAssumption is disabled because the Unit class uses a mix of
# eager initialization (in initialize_instance_variables) and lazy initialization
# (using defined? checks) for its instance variables. This is an intentional design
# pattern where some variables are initialized immediately and others are computed
# on first access for performance reasons.
#
# See: https://github.com/troessner/reek/blob/master/docs/Instance-Variable-Assumption.md
#
# RepeatedConditional warnings are configured below to exclude legitimate cases where
# the same condition needs to be checked in different methods for different purposes:
#
# - base?: Checked in to_base (early return), update_base_scalar (base unit calculation),
#   and unit_signature_vector (recursion avoidance). Each serves a distinct purpose.
#
# - other: Type checking in operator overloading methods using case statements.
#   This is a standard Ruby pattern for implementing polymorphic operators.
#
# - prefix_value: Checked in to_base (numerator/denominator processing) and parse
#   (string parsing). These are completely different contexts.
#
# - temperature?: Checked in multiple methods (to_base, temperature_scale, arithmetic
#   operators, power/root) where each serves a different purpose (conversion, formatting,
#   validation, etc.).
